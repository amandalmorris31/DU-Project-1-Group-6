# DU-Project-1-Group-6

This is our first team project.

Application Idea: We wanted to create a fun application for people at home in quarantine during the crazy times of COVID-19 looking for a little cocktail inspiration, while also able to find shows/movies to watch on their favorite streaming service while they sip on their new drink! 

Workflow: User will search a drink or an ingredient they wish to use and a cocktail recipe will appear based on that user's search. User is also able to search a movie or show they wish to watch and are linked to the show's page on various different streaming services so the user can choose which works best for them. 

WHEN user searches a drink such as "margarita"
THEN call the cocktail api 
THEN display drink thumbnail image and drink name
THEN display recipe and ingredients for said drink
WHEN user searches for a show/movie
THEN call api for streaming services and update link to said show/movie title page for that streaming site.
